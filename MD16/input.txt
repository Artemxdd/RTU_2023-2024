Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm

In computer science, the Knuth-Morris-Pratt string searching 
algorithm (or KMP algorithm) searches for occurrences of 
a "word" W within a main "text string" S by employing the 
observation that when a mismatch occurs, the word itself 
embodies sufficient information to determine where the 
next match could begin, thus bypassing re-examination 
of previously matched characters.

The algorithm was conceived in 1970 by Donald Knuth and 
Vaughan Pratt, and independently by James H. Morris. The 
three published it jointly in 1977. Independently, 
Matiyasevich got in 1969 a similar algorithm, coded by 
a two-dimensional Turing machine, by studying a string 
pattern matching recognition problem.

Boyer-Moore string search algorithm

In computer science, the Boyer-Moore string search algorithm is 
an efficient string searching algorithm that is the standard 
benchmark for practical string search literature. It was 
developed by Robert S. Boyer and J Strother Moore in 1977. 
The algorithm preprocesses the string being searched for 
(the pattern), but not the string being searched in (the text). 
It is thus well-suited for applications in which the pattern is 
much shorter than the text or where it persists across multiple 
searches. The Boyer-Moore algorithm uses information gathered 
during the preprocess step to skip sections of the text, 
resulting in a lower constant factor than many other string 
search algorithms. In general, the algorithm runs faster as 
the pattern length increases. The key features of the algorithm 
are to match on the tail of the pattern rather than the head, 
and to skip along the text in jumps of multiple characters 
rather than searching every single character in the text.
